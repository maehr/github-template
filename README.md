# GitHub template for small projects

This is a GitHub template designed for small projects that is independent of the programming language used. It uses various GitHub features to manage issues and pull requests, while enforcing best practices for small projects.

[![GitHub issues](https://img.shields.io/github/issues/maehr/github-template.svg)](https://github.com/maehr/github-template/issues)
[![GitHub forks](https://img.shields.io/github/forks/maehr/github-template.svg)](https://github.com/maehr/github-template/network)
[![GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/maehr/github-template.svg)](https://github.com/maehr/github-template/stargazers)
[![GitHub license](https://img.shields.io/github/license/maehr/github-template.svg)](https://github.com/maehr/github-template/blob/main/LICENSE.md)

## Why use a template (even for small projects)

- Write better [documentation](#documentation) for you and the community
- Write more [consistent](#consistency) code and foster collaboration
- Increase [security](#security)
- Follow recognized [ethical principles](#ethics)
- Promote [Free and Open-source software](#foss)
